# 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder
The design is implemented using 500nm technology.

## 1-bit Full Adder
<ul>
  Full adder was implemented using Transmission Gate Logic for low power design.
  Less number of transistors are used for less chip area and less power dissipation.
</ul>

## 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder
<ul>
  The circuitry was extended from the full adder circuitry.
  In the worst case the power dissipation is 111.50 micro Watts and propagation delay is 2.6 ns
</ul>
